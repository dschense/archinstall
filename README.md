## dschense's Arch Installer Scripts

This is my own customized install script for Arch Linux inspired by [BugsWriter's arch-linux-magic](https://github.com/Bugswriter/arch-linux-magic) & [Gianmarco's Arch Installer Script](https://git.gianmarco.ga/gianmarco/gais)

## Howto Start:

    $ pacman -Sy
    $ pacman -S github
    $ git clone https://github.com/dschense/archinstall.git
    $ cd archinstall
    $ sh arch.sh

**Important disclaimer**: this script is still experimental, so not everything works and things might go horribly wrong.
