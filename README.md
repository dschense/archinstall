## Gianmarco's Arch Installer Script

This is my own customized install script for Arch Linux inspired by [BugsWriter's arch-linux-magic](https://github.com/Bugswriter/arch-linux-magic).

**Important disclaimer**: this script is still experimental, so not everything works and things might go horribly wrong.
