## Gianmarco's Arch Installer Script

This is my own customized install script for Arch Linux inspired by [BugsWriter's arch-linux-magic](https://github.com/Bugswriter/arch-linux-magic).

curl -Lo arch.sh https://bit.ly/3snyXU7
chmod +x arch.sh
sh arch.sh

**Important disclaimer**: this script is still experimental, so not everything works and things might go horribly wrong.
